## ⚙️ Data Architect

Basic Data Architect used for this project to build Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.

![Data Architect](./assets/images/Architecture.png)

1. **Bronze Layer**: The raw data storage layer, where data is ingested directly from source systems (e.g., CSV files) into the **SQL Server database** without modifications. This layer acts as a **staging area**, preserving the original data for historical reference and traceability.
2. **Silver Layer**: The data transformation layer, where raw data undergoes **cleansing, standardization, and normalization** to ensure consistency, accuracy, and integrity, making it suitable for deeper analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: The business-ready layer, where data is **modeled into a structured star schema**, optimized for **reporting, analytics, and decision-making**.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

This project involves:

- **Data Architecture**: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse using the Medallion Architecture (**Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers).
- **ETL Pipelines**: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
- **Data Modeling**: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.

This repository is an excellent resource for professionals and students looking to showcase expertise in:

- SQL Development
- Data Architecture
- Data Engineering
- ETL Pipeline Development
- Data Modeling
- Data Analytics

## 🚀 Project Requirements

### 🧱 Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

**Objective**  
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

**Specifications**

- **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
- **Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

---

## ⚙️ ETL (Extract Transform and Load)

The ETL process is the backbone of this data warehouse project, ensuring seamless data ingestion, transformation, and integration from multiple sources into a structured analytical model. This project follows a layered Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold) to progressively refine raw data into a business-ready format for reporting and analytics.

## 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This section includes powerful SQL queries to extract actionable insights from the **Gold Layer** tables: `dim_customers`, `dim_products`, and `fact_sales`.

---

### 👤 Customer Insights

**1. Schema Check**

```sql

SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'gold' AND table_type = 'BASE TABLE';

SELECT
  column_name,
  data_type,
  is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'gold'
  AND table_name = 'your_table_name';

SELECT 'dim_customers' AS table_name, COUNT(*) FROM gold.dim_customers
UNION ALL
SELECT 'dim_products', COUNT(*) FROM gold.dim_products
UNION ALL
SELECT 'fact_sales', COUNT(*) FROM gold.fact_sales;
```

**2. Gold.dim_customers Table Check**

```sql
SELECT gender, COUNT(*) FROM gold.dim_customers GROUP BY gender;

SELECT DATE_PART('year', AGE(date_of_birth)) AS age, COUNT(*)
FROM gold.dim_customers
GROUP BY age ORDER BY age;

SELECT preferred_store, COUNT(*)
FROM gold.dim_customers
GROUP BY preferred_store
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
```

**3. Gold.dim_products Table Check**

```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(*)
FROM gold.dim_products
GROUP BY category ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

SELECT defect_flag, COUNT(*)
FROM gold.dim_products
GROUP BY defect_flag;

SELECT supplier_name, COUNT(*)
FROM gold.dim_products
GROUP BY supplier_name
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**4. Gold.fact_sales Table Check**

```sql
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) AS order_month, COUNT(*)
FROM gold.fact_sales
GROUP BY order_month
ORDER BY order_month;

SELECT
  AVG(ship_date - order_date) AS avg_shipping_days,
  MAX(ship_date - order_date) AS max_shipping_days
FROM gold.fact_sales;

SELECT order_status, SUM(net_sales) AS total_sales
FROM gold.fact_sales
GROUP BY order_status;
```

**5. Health Check**

```sql
SELECT
    conname AS constraint_name,
    conrelid::regclass AS table_from,
    a.attname AS column_from,
    confrelid::regclass AS table_to,
    af.attname AS column_to
FROM   pg_constraint
JOIN   pg_class ON conrelid = pg_class.oid
JOIN   pg_attribute a ON a.attrelid = conrelid AND a.attnum = ANY(conkey)
JOIN   pg_attribute af ON af.attrelid = confrelid AND af.attnum = ANY(confkey)
WHERE  contype = 'f'
AND    pg_class.relnamespace::regnamespace::text = 'gold';
```
