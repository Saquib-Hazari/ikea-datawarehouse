-- Key Techniques:
-- ---------------
-- âœ… JOINs across dimensions and fact tables to build context-rich aggregations.
-- âœ… Window Functions for ranking, partitioning, and time-based segmentation.
-- âœ… CTEs (Common Table Expressions) for breaking down complex logic.
-- âœ… Filters with conditional logic to isolate subsets like defective products or recent orders.
-- âœ… Calculated Metrics (e.g., discount-to-sales ratio, order size) for business performance monitoring.

-- Business Impact:
-- ----------------
-- These insights are designed to support strategic decisions in:
-- - Customer segmentation and loyalty programs
