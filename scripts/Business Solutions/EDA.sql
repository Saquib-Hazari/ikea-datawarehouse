-- ================================================
-- ðŸ“Š EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS ON GOLD LAYER
-- ================================================
-- 1. Inspect gold schema tables and their structures.
-- 2. Record counts for dim_customers, dim_products, fact_sales.
-- 3. Perform EDA on:
--    â€¢ dim_customers â†’ gender, age, preferred_store
--    â€¢ dim_products â†’ category, defect_flag, top suppliers
--    â€¢ fact_sales â†’ monthly orders, shipping times, sales by status
-- 4. Run schema health checks:
--    â€¢ Foreign key constraint mapping
--    â€¢ Index definitions across all gold tables
